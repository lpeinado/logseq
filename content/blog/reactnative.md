- The different types of components can be grouped like this:

- When installing an npm package globally we use: #card
  card-last-interval:: -1
  card-repeats:: 1
  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-08-09T22:00:00.000Z

  card-last-score:: 1
	- npm install --global expo-cli(package)
- To run a global npm command. in MacOS we do: #card
  card-last-interval:: 29.21
  card-repeats:: 5
  card-ease-factor:: 1.94
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-04T19:58:57.207Z

	- npx expo init <projectFolder>

- Once an Expo project is created we can run commands like: #card
  card-last-interval:: 33.32
  card-repeats:: 4
  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-08-16T17:04:24.002Z

  card-last-score:: 5
	- npm start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
	- npm run android
	- npm run ios
	- npm run web
- To make the expo thing work I had to modify the $PATH variable to make the Mac run it, as it wasn't able to find the binaries. Here is how [$PATH explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62971258/expo-cli-installed-but-when-running-any-expo-command-i-get-zsh-command-not-fou)
- Expo is: #card

	- An application that allows you to launch your RN app in web, android or iOS
	- TODO You need an account so the whole thing is stored there.  investigate this more

- A .gitkeep file is: #card
  card-last-interval:: 33.64
  card-repeats:: 4
  card-ease-factor:: 2.9

  card-last-score:: 5
	- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-gitkeep/
	- A dummy file to keep track of empty folders. This is because git only keeps track of files, if a folder is empty, it wont add it to the repo, and other developers won't see the folder structure at all.
- To open Development Menu: #card
  card-last-interval:: 28.3
  card-repeats:: 4

- To catch up with the rest of the Merryfield team, I have to read [THIS PAGE](https://www.reactnative.express/) notes about it will be taken in page #reactexpress

- What are the 2 main rules to remember about Reactnative Hook useRef() #reactnative #card

	- Updating a ref (instantiated via a= useRef()) doesn't trigger the components re-rendering.
	- The value of the ref (myRef.current) persists across the components re-renderings.
- The 3 differences between useRef and useState RN Hooks are: #reactnative #card
  card-last-interval:: -1
  card-repeats:: 1
  card-ease-factor:: 2.22
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-08-18T22:00:00.000Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-08-18T09:51:39.159Z
  card-last-score:: 1
	- Updating ref current value doesn't trigger the component's re-rendering. While updating the state does.
	- Updating the reference is synchronous (updated value is available right away) but updating a state is asynchronous (the new updated value is available after component's re-rendering)
	- Therefore, refs are used mostly for storing infrastructure data of side-effects, while state is mostly for data that has to be rendered or updated in the UI
- One of the most important usages of useRef React Hook is: #reactnative #card

	- Use them to point to a DOM element and then we can access to it for manipulation
	- The way to do it is:
		- Create the ref `const myRefToEl = useRef()`
		- Assign it to the dom element via props: `<div ref="myRefToEl" />``
		- After components rendering, link them: ` useEffect(()=> const divElement = myRefToEl.current = ,[]);
- Dimensions.get('window') vs Dimensions.get('screen') #card #reactnative

  collapsed:: true
	- `window` 's height <Â  `screen` 's height. So in all likelihood, this means:
	- `window` : reports width/height without the soft menu bar
	- `screen` : reports entire screen's width/height
	- In MF codebase we have many of both
