- Nuxt3 is a framework based on vue
- The main benefit of Nuxt3 is SEO performance, achieved by:
	- SSR Server Side Rendering - Build in real time so always up to date.
	- SSG Static Site Generation - Renders pages at build time (before deploy) Faster
- We can deploy in both ways with Nuxt.
- It has out of the box vue router and vue meta
	- No need to config, just put the files in the related folders
- It provides Layout templates so you can build layouts to be shared in different pages (blog post, list of items, landing pate, etc)
